I'm an Assistant Professor at <a href='https://www.radc.rush.edu'>Rush Alzheimer's Disease Center</a> , where I lead groundbreaking research on neurodegenerative diseases using data-driven methods. 

<strong>If you're interested in applying or honing your data science skills in healthcare</strong>, we have a variety of roles available, including data management, bioinformatics, and machine learning - opportunities are available for both on-site (Chicago) and remote positions. 
International students are also encouraged to reach out; we're keen on finding collaborative solutions. 
<strong>Feel free to DM me if you're interested.</strong>

Throughout my career, I've championed the use of <strong>data-intensive techniques</strong> to transform our understanding and treatment of diseases ranging from cancer to autoimmune disorders. My primary focus is on building computational models that capture biological processes and provide revolutionary pathways for therapeutic development. 

Outside of research, I enjoy playing pickleball, tennis, basketball, and working out at the gym. I also enjoy traveling and celebrating my family's accomplishments.
